# Day 5 - Job Search Tracker

Any serious endeavor can always benefit from data. If you haven't already, its time to develop a method to track the jobs you are pursuing. Make a spreadsheet or database to document jobs which you are considering or have applied to.

Here are some potential tools to use to create your job tracker: [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel), [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/projects), [Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)

You can decide how detailed or concise you want your spreadsheet\(s\) to be, but here are some suggestions on fields to include:

* Company Name
* Job Title
* Company Website Link
* Date Applied
* Notes

A separate table to track your correspondences with each company may be helpful.

Here is a sample job tracking database using Airtable:
