# Day 2 - Define your dream job

Think about exactly what roles you are interested in pursuing. Software developer/engineer is too broad. 

Points to consider:

* What are your non-negotiable requirements?
* What does a healthy company culture look like to you?
* What are your superpowers \(what are you good at + comes naturally to you\)?
