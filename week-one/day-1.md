# Day 1 - Write a letter to future me

Let's start with a goal.

Let's get quiet and still for a moment and think about what our desired outcome is. 

After you've had some time to think and reflect, you can get started on the prompt for today.

* Figure out what day it will be 100 days from now. Google can tell you. [https://www.google.com/search?&q=what+is+100+days+from+today](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=what+is+100+days+from+today)
* Head to [FutureMe](https://www.futureme.org) and write a letter to the version of you who has finished this job search challenge. It's up to you what you think future you should hear from present you. 

I'll be sending congratulations and letting future me know what my concerns and hopes are today, job related and otherwise.
