# Welcome to the 100 Days of Job Search Challenge

This guide to the challenge is a living document. This is a guide and a framework to follow. Feel free to make it your own. Do all of the things listed here or do none of it.  One way to do this challenge is [to fork this repo](https://github.com/PopSchools/100-days-of-job-search-docs) and update the daily prompts with your own content and progress. 

The idea of the challenge is to get job ready, possibly get job offers in the next 100 days, and to do it with the support of a community of peers and mentors.

The goal deliverables after 100 days:

* Resume\(s\) tailored to a specific job role
* A complete LinkedIn profile
* A published portfolio, blog site, or personal website
* A Twitter "for hire" post
