# A simple approach to the challenge

### A daily GitHub contribution

Choose a project that you will add versions and features to during the challenge. Make a contribution that shows in your activity every non-holiday week day.

### Write about your work

As you continue to build daily and show progress on GitHub, write about what you're building and what you are learning. Publish your best blog posts on LinkedIn.

### Tweet daily

Use the hashtag [\#100DaysOfJobSearch](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfJobSearch&src=hashtag_click) and tag [@100dojs](https://twitter.com/100dojs)

### Read and make connections on LinkedIn
